# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

This project provides introduction to the world of excel by discovering trends in the Kickstarter data set more specifically analyzing and finding trends related to theater launch campaigns.

### Purpose

The purpose of this project is to offer Louise insigth on how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch date and the their funding goals.

## Analysis and Challenges

The main analysis happens in 2 different parts. The first part of the analysis happens at a hollistic level showing which time periods have had successfull launch outcomes while the second part of the analysis reveals which campaigns have reached, exceeded or failed their fund raising goals 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

A pivot table and line graph was created to compare the total number of outcomes of a theatre production versus the month the theatre production came out. In order to achieve the resultant graph and pivot table filters was placed in the year and category fields. To the get the years, the YEAR() function was used to extract the year from the "Date Created Conversion" column found in the Kickstarted raw data set. Once the filters were added the outcomes column was added to the columns and values field while the "Date created Conversion" column was filtered to show just the months and than added to the rows field to obtain the pivot table which was than charted to obtain the resultant graph below. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
